## Email Sender: Effortlessly Send Emails and Verification Codes in Your Android App

This developer-friendly library simplifies sending emails and verification codes (OTPs) directly from your Android project. It utilizes the well-known Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for reliable email delivery.

Key Features:

 - Effortless Integration: Add the library to your project with just a few lines in your gradle files.
 - Secure Email Sending: Send emails from any Gmail account with proper security measures in place. (Important: Don't forget to follow the instructions from link to enable SMTP on your sender Gmail account.)
 - Flexible Functionality: Choose between sending regular emails or generating OTPs for verification purposes.

# Getting Started:

## Set up Gradle:
 - Add this at the end of your repositories (**settings.gradle**)
    ```
    repositories {
        ....
        maven {
            url = uri("https://jitpack.io")
        }
    }
    ```
 - Add the dependency 
 
     ```
      dependencies {
            implementation "com.github.MohamedKandel:email-sender:latest-release"
        }
    ```
# Simple Usage:

The library provides two convenient methods for sending emails and generating OTPs:<br/>

 - ```sendEmail(context, senderMail, senderPassword, displayName, receiverMail, subject, body, funToExecAfterSent)```<br/>
   This method allows you to send emails with customizable sender details, subject, body, and a callback function for post-sending actions.<br/>
 - ```sendOTP(context, senderMail, senderPassword, displayName, OTPLength, receiverMail, funToExecAfterSent)```<br/> Generate OTP codes with this method. Specify the desired OTP length and receive the generated code as a String.

    Remember: Always use a secure, encrypted password for senderPassword.
